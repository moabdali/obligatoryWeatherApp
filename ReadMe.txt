A simple weather app to play around with more APIs and GUI practice


v.0.4 - more frames added (better formatting) including option to type city (doesn't function yet) and to select a mode.  Have not actually implemented the changes after you choose a mode.  Need a logic switch for how to format it depending on whether it's day or night (might be easier to just suppress day 14 if it's already night so you don't only see a loose day for the 14th day.

v.0.3 - frames added, resized properly.  Todo: allow user to pick their city (somewhat implemented already, just need to add to GUI and uncomment the code), allow user to show a "mini mode" that only shows the day and picture, consolidate the program so that the day/night stack vertically (this will reduce the horizontal space, but increase the vertical space)

v.02 - horizontal, but needs frames

v.01 - a basic version that is really ugly (both codewise and output wise).  Currently shows the icons vertically, which is sinfully bad.  Going to make it be horizontal and practice with columns, but first I'm going to upload this so that I have a fall back point.
