A simple weather app to play around with more APIs and GUI practice

v.0.3 - frames add, resized properly.  Todo: allow user to pick their city (somewhat implemented already, just need to add to GUI and uncomment the code), allow user to show a "mini mode" that only shows the day and picture, consolidate the program so that the day/night stack vertically (this will reduce the horizontal space, but increase the vertical space)

v.02 - horizontal, but needs frames

v.01 - a basic version that is really ugly (both codewise and output wise).  Currently shows the icons vertically, which is sinfully bad.  Going to make it be horizontal and practice with columns, but first I'm going to upload this so that I have a fall back point.
